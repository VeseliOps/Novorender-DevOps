NovoRender Challenge #2 Cloud infrastructure deployment
1) "We currently use Microsoft Azure but pick the one you feel more comfortable with." -> Using AWS
2) "The deployment script may be a terraform app or a script in a language of your choice" -> Created both Terraform and Python -> created EC2, S3 bucket, VPC
3) Credentials are not hardcoded in the code -> Created IAM role
4) "az login" and "subscription ID" are provided through Azure, IAM on AWS
